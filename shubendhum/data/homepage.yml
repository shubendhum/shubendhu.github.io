    With over 17 years of experience in digital identity and cloud technologies, I am known for being a fast learner and an all-rounder, quickly adapting to new challenges and consistently delivering results. In both my professional and personal life, I am often regarded as a problem solver—whether it’s providing technical guidance, friendly advice on legal or business matters, or even offering insights into home building, I bring a broad perspective and a keen analytical mind to every situation. As a Senior Technology Manager at ANZ Bank, I lead high-performing teams and deliver strategic digital identity solutions that drive business value. My ability to absorb new information quickly and apply it effectively enables me to navigate complex projects and lead initiatives that have a lasting impact.
